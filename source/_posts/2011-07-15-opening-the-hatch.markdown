title: "Opening The Hatch"
---

I first heard of [OpenHatch][1] quite a while ago, but didn't really play around with a whole lot.  After floundering quite a bit about what programming I wanted to do in my free time, I re-read an old [slashdot article][2] that got me really thinking about it again.  For some reason, I was of the mentality that it would be better to produce software that was closed source, in the hope of making a profit from it.  In reality, it's far better for me to simply have the much-needed experience that I don't yet have when it comes to producing and releasing software.

Simply getting involved, with the help of the individuals on OpenHatch, as well as learning the common tools used in open source software, is my new goal.  I hope to take the advice of Mark (the author of the linked article), and ask the more knowledgeable developers for a good starting point, and take on the challenge!
