I ran into a small bug in the latest pull from the octopress source.  It was complaining about .DS_Store files:

	âžœ  jcsims.me git:(master) rake deploy
	rake aborted!
	No such file or directory - public/_layouts/.DS_Store

	Tasks: TOP => deploy
	(See full trace by running task with --trace)

It's currently an [issue][1], but in the short-term I needed to remove all the pesky files from the project.
Enter this nice and easy command:

	find ./ -name \.DS_Store -ok rm {} \;
