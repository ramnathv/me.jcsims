I switched to a new static site framework based on [Jekyl][1], called [Octopress][2].  It seems to be a bit more polished then using nanoc tweaked to be a blogging engine. The new site isn't completely finished (I still need links to the about and wishlist pages in the navbar), but provides a very polished base to start from.
