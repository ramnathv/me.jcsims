title: "Additions To The Orange Crush"
---

The Orange Crush (my KTM 990 ADV) got some lovin' today.  I added a bash plate and a sidestand relocation kit from [Black Dog Cycle Works][1], and finally added the power cable for the GPS.  Luckily, there was a spare always-on set of power spades behind the headlight, so it was an easy addition.  Yesterday, I lined the interior of my panniers with cork contact paper, to prevent everything inside from turning black, as well as adding a bit of cushion:

Looking forward to the Overland Rally and riding the Washington Backcountry Discovery Route!
