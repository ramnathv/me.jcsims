I just submitted my first [pull request][pull] to fix an [issue][issue] with my blogging platform of choice, octopress.

It was surprising how good it made me feel, even though it was such a small fix.  It took me about 10 minutes of thinking
about it, trying to imagine where the issue might lie and running some simple tests in irb.  I had to slow myself down and
run a few verification tests.  I had this fear that someone else would submit the fix before me!

In the end, this directly affected me as an octopress user, and I'm glad that it was an obvious fix.  The maintainer of
octopress, Brandon Mathis, merged the pull request within just a couple minutes, and I pulled down the fix shortly thereafter.
Github made it extremely easy to fork it, fix, submit a pull request, and add a link to the pull request on the issue. 
Free software for the win!
