On Sunday, my wife is heading off to training.  She's joining the [NOAA Corps][1], which is great because she gets to continue her government service, spend a lot of time near or on the ocean, learn and develop as a person, and not sit in an office (most of the time).

It'll be tough to be apart (especially so soon after we got married - only 3 weeks!), but I'm not worried.  We should be moving to somewhere near Providence or Boston, so it'll be fun!
