**Update:** Asheesh from OpenHatch put up my fork of calagator for some testing [here][6].  Check it out!

I recently did some work for [openhatch][1], doing a quick and dirty theme for [calagator][2].  My patch is in a [gist][3] and [another][4].  To apply the theme, clone the calagator repository, get it setup for either testing or deployment according to the readme, and apply the patch.  The changes are encompassed in the [openhatch_theme branch][5] in my fork.
