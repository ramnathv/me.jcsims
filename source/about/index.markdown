![here's looking at you](/images/chris.png)

My name is Chris Sims, and I am a computer science student.  I grew up in the Vancouver, WA area, and will be relocating to the
East Coast later this year.  I'm married to a beautiful woman, [Kasey Sims](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=25907126).


## Work

I just completed a 3-month internship for Logitech, at the Camas site.  I worked on an internal product
used to test speakers to obtain subjective test results.  I coded in C# and C++, and used the .NET Framework, 
DirectShow APIs, and Silverlight.

I prefer to work in Objective-C (mostly iOS programming), and I'm endeavoring to learn more and more about ruby.
