![here's looking at you][chris_img]

My name is Chris Sims, and I am a computer science student.  I grew up in the Vancouver, WA area, and recently relocated to Rhode Island.  I'm married to a beautiful woman, [Kasey Sims][1].

Hit the links on the footer for the rest of my presence on the web.


## Work

In June of 2011, I completed a 3-month internship for Logitech at their Camas site.  I worked on an internal product
used to test speakers to obtain subjective test results.  I coded in C# and C++, and used the .NET Framework,
DirectShow APIs, and Silverlight.

I'm really enthusiastic about developing for the web, specifically HTML5, CSS3, and Ruby on
Rails.
